# Ancient Athens
An interactive map to explore ancient Athens
by Yixuan (Emily) Hu

This project is for the final of MUSA611 Introduction to Web Mapping, with course material from ARTH530 Athenian Topography. 
My sincere appreciation for my awesome instructors - Nathan and Ross, great TA - Huiling, and Prof. Mantha for allowing me use material related to Athens.
